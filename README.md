# Face Recognition Brain â€” Frontend

## Project Overview

This is the frontend part of the **Face Recognition Brain** web application, which allows users to recognize faces in images by providing an image URL. Users input the URL into a text field, and the app displays the detected faces.

The frontend handles the user interface: input, image display, and visualization of face recognition results received from the backend API.
